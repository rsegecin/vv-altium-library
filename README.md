# Setting up the connection
1. Open `vidavidorra Library Database Connection.udl.txt` and replace `your_user`, `your_password` and `database_server` with the information you were emailed, or the information for your own (local) database.
2. Remove the `.txt` extension. The file should now be named  `vidavidorra Library Database Connection.udl`
3. Open the udl-file by double-clicking it. It should open a new window like shown in the image below, obviously with your actual information.
